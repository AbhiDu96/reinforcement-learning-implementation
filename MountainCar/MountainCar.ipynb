    "Consider the task of driving an underpowered car up a steep mountain road, as suggested by the diagram. The difficulty is that gravity is stronger than the car’s engine, and even at full throttle the car cannot accelerate up the steep slope. The only solution is to first move away from the goal and up the opposite slope on the left.\n",

    "The reward in this problem is -1 on all time steps until the car moves past its goal position at the top of the mountain, which ends the episode. There are three possible actions: full throttle forward (+1), full throttle reverse (01), and zero throttle (0). The car moves according to a simplified physics. Its position, `x_t`, and velocity, `x_ ̇t`, are updated by:\n",

When it reached the right bound, the goal was reached and the episode was terminated. Each episode started from a random position `xt` in `[-0.6, -0.4)` and zero velocity.\n",
